## Hello There
I am a high school student from poland.
I am an aspiring developer. I especially enjoy front-end coding:
+ React
+ Svelte
I like trying new things. Lately I have been on a journey of testing beverages for example HIRRO.
Back to the important things. I have a huge experience in Java Script. Also I have worked in a few backend frameworks.
+ Flask + MySQLAlchemy
+ Express

Something more about me:
I have a mother and a brother and a father and a cat. 
I love hitting the jim with my great friends -> [k3rasjan](github.com/k3rasjan) you can see my progress [here💪🏿](https://hevy.com/user/akre)
I like anime and children. Those are a huge part of my life but not the only huge part of me 😉

I have done a few projects which you can see [here](github.com/xAkre)
Also I have been a student of Zespół Szkół Komunikacji for 2 years but I quit in order to pursue my dream -> becoming the best developer in this Multiverse😎 usulesness school ngl

I have also lived in the Great United Kingdom for most of my life hence my English is as fluent as it can get 🇬🇧🧐
